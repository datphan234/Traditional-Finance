Apply programming skills to the traditional financial market

I started my journey in the crypto market and began to love finance in general. A curious guy just wants to apply maths and statistics to the finanical markets via python.

Not a TA expert or finance guru.

Please feel free to use and if you have any comments, discussion or suggestions please let me know

Thank you and all the best
